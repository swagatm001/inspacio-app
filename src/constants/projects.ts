  description: `Anthology is a global workplace continually striving toward deeper inclusivity, authenticity, and professional advancement. We were assigned the task to design the workspace with an
  idea that showcase a contemporary smart approach to design, technology and aesthetics.
  Architect and the entire team of interior designers produce sketches, 3D models, 3D
  rendering of commercial space simulations to help clients visualize the results. After multiple
  brainstorming and presentations with the client, we finalized on the interiors of the space.
  The structural glazing of the building and the arial view of passing metro rails, embracing in
  natural light brightening the workspace and makes the office feel bigger and more spacious. The workspace, meeting rooms and collaborative spaces were strategically planned which
  reduces the usage of lights and Airconditioning extensively. A big welcoming reception along
  with collaborative spaces create a sense of openness. Strategically placed warm color
  palette and beautiful lighting in lounge/ meeting rooms adds in more drama and life to the
  space.

  description: `Redesigning the office space was to create a fresh, new and impressive look and feel for Celegence team. There was another valuable goal that aimed for: better utilization of space. A dull, bland, and unfurnished interior space, no matter how functional, will never impart pleasant vibes. In our initial visit to the existing office, we came up with an idea to redesign the entire space, and upgrading according to recent trends. The process begins with a meeting between the architect/ interior designer, project manager and the client’s Project manager, who is in charge of the commercial project. The three stakeholders brainstorm ideas to understand their feasibility for the given space and prepare the schematics, concepts to finally freezing on the design for executions. The workspace was changed from curvilinear to linear workstations opening up more collaborative spaces. Adding different textures, colours, patterns to the space was the main concept to uplift the space from a dull and old look ambiance to a bright, energetic and motivated office ambiance.  Bringing in more natural light and adding the biophilic use of plants more generously brought in positive effects on employee well-being. Staying focused on the client’s needs and achieving high-end results within the assigned budget was the ultimate motive.

The main room of the house is the open plan living space comprising kitchen, dining and lounge area. A spacious kitchen with breakfast bar, a dining table set for dinner, and a casual sitting area looking out onto the garden. We captured some of the latest interior design trends. A separate sitting room is designed with a cozier feel. Here we added a beautiful brick wallcovering to form the backdrop to the room, and lit the space with a selection of lamps. Embroidered cushions and bright silks and velvets give a much more grown-up feel to this room. The bedrooms were all designed with elegant and inviting schemes – luxurious and contemporary in character. We dressed the fourth bedroom as a study. Using modern furnishings and lighting, with colorful accents and accessories, suggests a space that could be used for working from home or studying.  `,
