  description: `Anthology is a global workplace continually striving toward deeper inclusivity, authenticity, and professional advancement. We were assigned the task of designing the workspace with an idea that showcases a contemporary smart approach to design, technology and aesthetics. The architect and the entire team of interior designers produced sketches, 3-D models and 3-D renderings of the commercial space simulations to help clients visualise the results. After multiple brainstorming and presentations with the client, we finalised the interiors of the space. The structural glazing of the building and the aerial view of passing metro rails, embracing natural light brightening the workspace and making the office feel bigger and more spacious. The workspace, meeting rooms and collaborative spaces were strategically planned, which extensively reduced the usage of lights and air conditioning. A big welcoming reception along with collaborative spaces create a sense of openness. Strategically placed warm colour palette and beautiful lighting in lounge/ meeting rooms added more drama and life to the space.`,

  description: `A recent handover of a small contemporary office space designed for corporate executive staff. In my early visit to the site, I realized that the space was quite small to accommodate a director's cabin, executive meeting room, conference, lounge, phone booth, workspace area, pantry & restrooms. That's when the team realized that another way to make this small office look modern yet stylish was by going white. An all-White interior design can make your office look calm and classy. One excellent benefit of a white office is that it creates an illusion of space. The room will appear bigger than it is in square feet. In an all-white office, consider texturing the walls. Wall art with bold colours would be an ideal texture for the white walls. Also, ensure you let in enough light to illuminate the entire office. You can achieve that by opening the windows or using light lamps. I intended to add a white pastel colour Jali partition, a wooden texture hexagonal ceiling, and a splash of colour that adds character to the space.
  
  Contemporary office designs focus on simple but stylish décor with aesthetic qualities based on the principles of building modern offices. When improving your office look, use contemporary furniture and a colour palette with neutral accents and tones to add character to your office.`,

  description: `Excleya, a renowned independent partner that serves Biotech, Pharma and Medical Device Organisations, was a wonderful space to revamp. The Kreative Dezine team had so much fun designing this modern workplace, spread across 10,000 sq. ft. Our ultimate goal was the same as it is for any other commercial project, to design a workplace that fosters productivity, collaboration and the well-being of employees. Apart from this, at Excelya, our team had the mission to create additional collaboration spaces, phone booths, and wall art and revamp the boardroom space. To begin with, we chose wall colours and wallpapers that were vibrant, playful and not distracting at all.  The phone booths were designed in a way that there is space for employees to sit and focus on their calls without feeling suffocated inside. Since the office space highlighted an open plan layout, encouraging communication and collaboration among employees, we decided to breakout areas, and collaborative zones. While each space stood out by itself, the workplace as a whole looked cohesive, which was the aim.`,

  description: `The Celegence team approached Kreative Dezine Studio to redesign their office space. The aim was to create a fresh, new and impressive look and feel. . Apart from these, the team also aimed for better utilization of space. A dull, bland, and unfurnished interior space, no matter how functional, will never impart pleasant vibes. In our initial visit to the existing office, we came up with an idea to redesign the entire space and upgrade it according to recent trends. The process begans with a meeting between the architect/ interior designer, project manager and the client’s project manager, who was in charge of the commercial project. The three stakeholders brainstormed ideas to understand the feasibility of the given space and prepared the schematics, and concepts to freeze on the design for executions finally. The workspace was changed from curvilinear to linear workstations, opening up more collaborative spaces. Adding different textures, colours and patterns to the space was the main concept to uplift the space from a dull ambience to a bright, energetic and motivated office ambience.  Bringing in more natural light and adding the biophilic use of plants more generously brought a positive effect on employees' well-being. Staying focused on the client’s requirements and achieving high-end results within the assigned budget was the ultimate motive.`,

When the team visited the Texport Overseas office to take a look at how we can make it better for the people to work here, we noticed quite a few things. First of all the space looked and felt cramped, the office featured a low ceiling, ancient workstations, narrow passages, lighting issues and wooden partitions, to name a few. The team got down to work. We took down the false ceiling and to our surprise, the ceiling was 14’ high ceiling, which not only brightened up the space and allowed daylight to seep in, but it also offered excellent ventilation and made the space look bigger. We also worked around the old-style workstations and swapped it for open workstations. Coming to the colours, we used tones of grey, green and wooden shades, giving it a calming effect.`,
