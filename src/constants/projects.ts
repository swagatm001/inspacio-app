    description: `Anthology is a global workplace continually striving toward deeper inclusivity, authenticity, and professional advancement. We were assigned the task to design the workspace with an
    idea that showcase a contemporary smart approach to design, technology and aesthetics.
    Architect and the entire team of interior designers produce sketches, 3D models, 3D
    rendering of commercial space simulations to help clients visualize the results. After multiple
    brainstorming and presentations with the client, we finalized on the interiors of the space.
    The structural glazing of the building and the arial view of passing metro rails, embracing in
    natural light brightening the workspace and makes the office feel bigger and more spacious. The workspace, meeting rooms and collaborative spaces were strategically planned which
    reduces the usage of lights and Airconditioning extensively. A big welcoming reception along
    with collaborative spaces create a sense of openness. Strategically placed warm color
    palette and beautiful lighting in lounge/ meeting rooms adds in more drama and life to the
    space.
