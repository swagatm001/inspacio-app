    question: "Q1. How do I know which design is best for my home?",
    answer: `KDS designers will evaluate your requirements and suggest a few designs that work best for your home interiors. However, you can suggest changes in the design or can ask for more design options. The best way to visualise the design is through a 3D virtual view. We provide 3D views of the design once finalised so that you can have a look at how your interiors will look once the project is completed.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Q2. Can I incorporate my ideas into the design?",
    answer: `Absolutely, you can incorporate your design ideas. The KDS team strongly believes that the design should align with your tastes and preferences. We welcome your contribution from the start.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Q3. Can I break up my execution into phases?",
    answer: `Yes, when the space is occupied, the team at KDS understands that the execution might have to be incorporated in phases at your convenience.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Q4. Do you also offer colour consultations?",
    answer: `KDS offers Interior Design Consultations, which are dedicated to selecting colours and other finishes that align with your personality.`,

  {
    question: "Q5. What is the benefit of having an interior designer who can manage the construction phase?",
    answer: `KDS has an expert team for project execution which makes it easier for the design team to coordinate and make sure that the project implementation and the final result are exactly as confirmed by you. An added benefit of having a design and execution team with the same firm is that you can avoid the hassle of following up if any issue arises during the execution phase; the KDS team is well known for a smooth execution and handover.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Q6. Do you have a general design style? Can my taste and preference be accommodated in your design?",
    answer: `KDS always strives to design unique and creative work, which is based on your taste, preferences, and personal choices; so you can contribute to the design process.`
